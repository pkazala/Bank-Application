# Banking Application

This application was built in a group of 5 during my University Course in Agile Software Development in Practice. We worked in sprints doing regular stand-ups and utilising Agile tools like Trello. The application interface was built with simple tools as it only utilised HTML, CSS and JavaScript (a bit of jQuery) and the API was built with Jooby, a Java Framework. My duties included building out the Front-End and Unit-Testing.
